# Project request


### Final Project Poster
I've included the requirements for the final project flyers that Dr. Scharff requested below. I've also attached the sample flyers from past classes to this announcement. Looks like she just requires a PDF with the requested content.

The poster should contain:

* Name of app
* Info about the team (names and emails)
* Logo
* Bit.ly to download your app (direct link to the apk file)
* QR code to download your app (apk file)
